The following architecture and tools are adopted as the first iteration:

**Module 1:** Python to connect and control devices.
**Module 2:** .NET to connect with databases, with PostgreSQL as the database.
**Module 3:** Python for data analysis and visualization.

**Database design:** The app will provide a default database for most users and tools (maybe a web interface) that allows advanced users to design and create their own databases. Embedded PostgreSQL will be used.
